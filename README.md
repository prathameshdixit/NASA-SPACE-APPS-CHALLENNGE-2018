Martian’s-Eye   (A device developed to track the atmosphere on planet Mars.)

Challenge: Develop sensors to be used by humans on planet Mars.

Problem: It’s only a matter of time before we are able to go to Mars and see, touch and inspect things that have only been visible through
the lenses of landers, rovers, and orbiters.The rovers and orbiters currently hovering over Mars are not solidly reliable, moreover there 
are certain parameters which are quite essential for human existence on Mars which are not properly studied by these devices.We need
sophisticated device boarded reliable sensors so that we will have the opportunity to build upon decades of past science experiments
from robotic missions, and we will explore familiar and new terrains and environments on Mars in person.

Solution: To overcome this problem, our team came up with a subtle solution wherein we use Raspberry Pi and related concepts to solve 
this issue. We use the Raspberry Pi camera module (v 1.3) which is mounted over the device itself.We also use an object detection sensor
and also a temperature sensor which is an added feature which we provide to keep a log of temperature and also hindrances.
